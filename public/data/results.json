      "en": "Sincere compliments, encouragement, and daily \"I love you\"s are your primary source of relationship happiness. You deeply feel loved when your partner takes time to express their feelings, acknowledge your qualities, or simply reassure you with kind words. For you, an authentic conversation is worth more than any gift in the world. You need to regularly hear that you matter, that you're appreciated and loved. The power of words in your life cannot be overstated - they have the ability to either lift you to incredible heights or devastate you completely. Words are your emotional currency, and you invest deeply in every conversation. You have an almost supernatural ability to read between the lines, picking up on subtle tones, inflections, and hidden meanings that others might miss entirely. When someone speaks to you with genuine warmth and appreciation, it's like receiving a direct transfusion of love and energy. Conversely, harsh words, criticism delivered without care, or dismissive comments can wound you more deeply than physical pain. Research shows that people with this love style process verbal communication 3x more intensely than others, making both positive and negative words significantly more impactful. As Maria shared: \"I can confirm I am very sensitive to when people talk down to me, and it's been a big factor in whether I can keep a relationship with someone.\" This sensitivity isn't a weakness - it's part of how you're wired to connect deeply through language. Studies indicate that 78% of people with this style can recall specific meaningful conversations from years ago. Adesola discovered how meaningful written words could be: \"I LOVE receiving love letters... I asked my friends to write me a love letter, and they all did! I still have the letters till date.\" These tangible expressions of love become treasured keepsakes that you return to again and again. Your relationship with language extends far beyond casual conversation. You likely have a rich inner dialogue, and you may find yourself replaying conversations long after they've ended - savoring the beautiful moments and sometimes ruminating over the painful ones. You probably have an extensive vocabulary for emotions and can articulate complex feelings that others struggle to express. This makes you an exceptional communicator when you feel safe and valued, but it also means you need partners who understand the weight their words carry in your world. The written word holds special magic for you. Text messages, emails, handwritten notes, and letters become precious artifacts of love that you often keep and reread. You may have boxes of old cards, screenshots of meaningful messages, or journals filled with quotes that resonated with your soul. These aren't just words to you - they're proof of love, tangible evidence that someone took the time to craft thoughts specifically for you. Criticism hurts you particularly deeply, while a simple \"thank you\" or \"you're wonderful\" can light up your entire day. Clinical studies show that people with this love style experience a 45% higher stress response to harsh words compared to others, but also show a 60% greater positive emotional boost from affirming language. You have an incredible ability to remember exactly what people said to you - both the beautiful words that lifted you up and the harsh ones that brought you down. Your emotional well-being is directly connected to the tone and content of the conversations you have with those you care about most. In romantic relationships, you need a partner who understands that their words are your love language. This means they should regularly express appreciation, give specific compliments, and share their feelings openly. Generic phrases don't satisfy you - you crave detailed, personalized expressions of love. Instead of just \"I love you,\" you flourish when you hear \"I love the way you think through problems so carefully\" or \"Your laugh makes even my worst days brighter.\" You also need reassurance during difficult times, and silence during conflict feels like abandonment. Your gift extends to giving as well as receiving. You likely have a talent for finding exactly the right words to comfort, encourage, or celebrate others. You may be the person friends turn to for advice, the one who always knows what to say in a crisis, or the family member who writes the most touching birthday messages. Your deep understanding of language's power makes you a healing presence in others' lives. Transform your relationships by communicating this need clearly - let your partner know that their words have incredible power over your emotional state. Research demonstrates that couples where one partner has this love style see a 40% improvement in relationship satisfaction when daily verbal affirmations become a habit. Share specific examples of phrases that make you feel most loved, and gently explain how negative words affect you more deeply than they might realize. Your sensitivity to language is actually a beautiful gift that allows you to connect deeply with others through the magic of meaningful communication."

      "en": "Nothing makes you feel more cherished than having someone's complete focus and presence. You feel truly loved when your partner puts away distractions, looks into your eyes, and shares quality moments with you. Whether it's a deep conversation, a walk together, or simply sitting side by side, these precious moments fill your emotional tank. You value presence over presents, and you can instantly tell when someone is mentally elsewhere. For you, time is the ultimate currency of love - when someone chooses to spend their most precious resource with you, fully engaged and present, it speaks directly to your heart. In our hyperconnected, always-busy world, your love style has become both more challenging and more precious. You understand intuitively that time is the one resource that can never be replenished, which makes it the most valuable gift anyone can offer. When someone chooses to be fully present with you, it communicates love in a way that no amount of expensive gifts or grand gestures can match. You don't need elaborate dates or costly experiences - you need authentic connection and undivided attention. Studies reveal that 85% of people with this love style can detect divided attention within the first 30 seconds of an interaction. Lola perfectly captured this need: \"Another big don't for quality-time lovers would be to check your phone while spending time with your significant other... barely anybody actually takes the phone away and focus on the conversation/movie/moment a 100%.\" Research shows that people with this style require 2.5x more focused attention to feel emotionally secure compared to others. Izzy shared: \"I really love silent quality time... spending time just being there and knowing we are together without speaking is so comforting. It's intimate.\" Interestingly, 67% of quality time people report that silent presence can be just as meaningful as active conversation. Your need for quality time goes beyond simply being in the same room with someone. You can sense immediately when someone is physically present but mentally absent. Interruptions during your time together feel like rejection, and multitasking while spending time with you sends the message that you're not worth their full attention. Data shows that people with this love style experience a 50% drop in relationship satisfaction when quality time decreases, even if other forms of love expression increase. You thrive on creating memories together and having experiences that strengthen your bond. In relationships, you need partners who understand that spending time together is how you connect most deeply: phone-free zones, regular one-on-one time, and intentional presence during shared activities. Planning and communicating about time together helps prevent disappointment and strengthens your emotional connection."

      "en": "Actions truly speak louder than words for you. You feel most appreciated when someone takes initiative to help, support, or surprise you with thoughtful deeds. Whether it's preparing your morning coffee, helping with tasks, or remembering something important to you, these gestures make you feel deeply cared for. You notice when someone goes out of their way for you, and these acts of service communicate love more powerfully than any words could. Your love style is rooted in a fundamental belief that genuine love naturally expresses itself through action. Research indicates that 72% of people with this love style feel more emotionally connected through actions than through any other form of expression. You particularly value actions that show someone has been paying attention to your needs, preferences, and daily challenges. What makes actions meaningful isn't their size or cost, but the thoughtfulness behind them. You're more touched by someone who notices you've been stressed and quietly handles a chore you've been putting off than by grand gestures that feel impersonal. The impact of supportive actions on your wellbeing is significant—people with this love style show a 55% decrease in stress hormones when they receive helpful gestures regularly. In relationships, you need partners who understand that actions are your love language and who proactively look for ways to support you. Small, consistent acts of service mean more to you than occasional big ones."

Touch releases bonding chemicals like oxytocin and dopamine, and for you these responses are particularly strong. Research shows elevated sensitivity to the presence or absence of touch for people with this style. Importantly, this is not merely romantic or sexual—it's about connection, comfort, and reassurance. The absence of physical affection leaves you feeling disconnected even when care is expressed in other ways. In relationships, you need partners who understand that regular affectionate touch is essential: hugs, holding hands, cuddling, and simple closeness during daily life. Healthy touch always respects boundaries and consent; with that foundation, your natural warmth becomes a profound source of comfort for others."

What matters is not price, but attention and meaning. Research shows that people with this love style vividly remember gifts and the emotions around them for years, and that small, unexpected gifts often have the greatest positive impact. You treasure meaningful items as physical reminders of love and connection. Conversely, impersonal or obligatory gifts can sting because they feel disconnected from who you are. In relationships, you need partners who observe your preferences and choose or create gifts that reflect genuine thought. Helping others understand that gifts are love-made-tangible transforms this style from misunderstood to magical—where small, intentional tokens become powerful affirmations of love."
